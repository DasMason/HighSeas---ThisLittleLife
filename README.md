Description:

This project was created to help me learn more about python and how to use it. I created this project with help from Microsoft's Copilot AI. I hope you enjoy messing around with this simulation and have fun toying with it!

How to use it yourself:

WARNING: IF YOU SET THE PARTICLE AMOUNT TO HIGH THE SIMULATION MIGHT LAG OR CRASH

Prerequisites:

-Pygame: https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted

-VSCode: https://code.visualstudio.com/download

-Python: https://www.python.org/downloads/

How to run the program:

Hopefully in the future I will have a better way of showcasing my project like a website or something but for now you have to do the following steps:

1. Download the LifeSim.py file from the repo
2. Open the file in VSCode
3. Click the "Run" button (it looks like a sideways triangle) in the top right
4. You're done!
